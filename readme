BA HomeWork Application

Requirements :
1. Recent Docker
2. minikube

Test Requirements :
 (Application is tested in local mode, hence all the requirements of application server apply here)
1. Ruby >=2.6.3
2. gem, sinatra, test/unit, rack/test, rspec

Clone repository into folder "bahw".
Once there, following is the sequence of commands necessary to bring up BAHW on local k8s cluster
bahw$ pwd
~home/runme/bahw

bahw$ docker build --tag theunixmaster/bahw-app:1.0.0 .
bahw$ docker push theunixmaster/bahw-app:1.0.0
bahw$ kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
bahw$ kubectl create -f service.yaml

Due to the nature of minukube network stack it is necessary to run minikube tunnel in the background
 to enable LoadBalancer cluster node
bahw$ minikube tunnel &
 or
bahw$ screen -S MK_TUNNEL minukube tunnel
 type [Ctrl^A-D] to detach from screen

 You can and should substitute "theunixmaster/bahw-app:1.0.0" for image tag appropriate for your Docker
 installation in docker build and push commands as well as deploy/deployment.yaml configuration file for k8s.
